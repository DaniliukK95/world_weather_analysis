# world_weather_analysis
The purpose of this repository is to show the skills we learned involving Jupyter notebook, Python, Pandas, and most importantly API's. We are combining all the knowledge we have learned to create code to access data from API's and then to manipulate them to give results like a search engine. Using Google's API's, we created heatmaps, displayed markers on maps displaying data of hotels nearest to randomly generated coordinates, and finally used a combination of everything to allow a user to input data (max and min temperature) to refine the search of cities to travel to. We used this to then make an itenerary for this user.
